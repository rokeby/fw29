a lick on the back of your neck
silky pajamas
a kiss in every nook
three moles shaped like the bermuda triangle
a basement K-hole
Deep pile rug
slightly leathery touch of a bullfrog's back
mishima's ears
fingers in the dark
sandstone
cold dune sand in the morning
glass
skinned citrus
alien gaze
hot sands whipping in the air
a wounded foot
feet digging into hot sand
a deep cosmic void
wet earth
soft tears
synchronised breath
humid sheets
