scorching sun
standing in a cloud
cool and arid
wet and humid
constantly changing winds
icy winds
a soft breeze across your cheeks
a kiss of sun
blue dusk
almost pitch black
cool morning fog
cold desert sand, still damp
a quiet sunset
voices over a moonlit lake
tall grass heated by the sun
dripping and hot
between seasons, chaotic atmosphere
thick smog
white disk of sun
swampy must
smell of new paint
early evening cigarette
breath
monsoon rains
